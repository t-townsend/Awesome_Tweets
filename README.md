# Awesome Tweets #
### A Messaging App ###
***
This is a messaging app that allows users to sign in and create tweets  
(characters restrained to 255). After pressing the submit button, the message
is appended to the top of the list, and appears under the message box. User
authentication was used, so the page cannot be altered if there is no one
logged in. It is a CRUD app, with edit and delete capabilities.
***
**Technologies Used: Node.js, Express.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Postgres, SQL**
